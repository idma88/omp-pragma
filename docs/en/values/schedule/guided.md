When `schedule(guided,` *chunk_size* `)` is specified, the iterations are assigned to threads in chunks with decreasing sizes. When a thread finishes its assigned chunk of iterations, it's dynamically assigned another chunk, until none is left. For a *chunk_size* of 1, the size of each chunk is approximately the number of unassigned iterations divided by the number of threads. These sizes decrease almost exponentially to 1. For a *chunk_size* with value *k* greater than 1, the sizes decrease almost exponentially to *k*, except that the last chunk may have fewer than *k* iterations. When no *chunk_size* is specified, it defaults to 1.
