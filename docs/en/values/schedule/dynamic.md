When `schedule(dynamic,` *chunk_size* `)` is specified, the iterations are divided into a series of chunks, each containing *chunk_size* iterations. Each chunk is assigned to a thread that's waiting for an assignment. The thread executes the chunk of iterations and then waits for its next assignment, until no chunks remain to be assigned. The last chunk to be assigned may have a smaller number of iterations. When no *chunk_size* is specified, it defaults to 1.
