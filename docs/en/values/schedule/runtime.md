When `schedule(runtime)` is specified, the decision regarding scheduling is deferred until runtime. The schedule *kind* and size of the chunks can be chosen at run time by setting the environment variable `OMP_SCHEDULE`. If this environment variable isn't set, the resulting schedule is implementation-defined. When `schedule(runtime)` is specified, *chunk_size* must not be specified.
