When `schedule(static,` *chunk_size* `)` is specified, iterations are divided into chunks of a size specified by *chunk_size*. The chunks are statically assigned to threads in the team in a round-robin fashion in the order of the thread number. When no *chunk_size* is specified, the iteration space is divided into chunks that are approximately equal in size, with one chunk assigned to each thread.
